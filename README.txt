This plugin is designed to extend and enhance the feedback feature of the legacy 12 Step Meeting List plugin. 

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to enhance the feedback feature of the legacy 12-step-meeting-list plugin found on its Meeting Detail screen. It provides a formatted solution to guide user feedback input, giving a consistent, auditable, and accurate view of what the feedback submitter is wanting added, changed, or removed in the 12 Step Meeting List.

== Installation ==

* Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
* Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= No 'Request a change to this listing' button found? =

Like the original feedback feature, this enhanced version requires a website administrator email address be entered in the "User Feedback Emails" field on the Meetings/Import & Settings page before the feedback system will display.

= What version of the 12 Step Meeting List plugin is required? =

Version 3.12 or later.

= Is there a way to un-hide the Contact Information fields on the Additional Group Information portion of the form? =

Add this to your (child) theme’s functions.php. 

		$tsml_hide_contact_information = false;
